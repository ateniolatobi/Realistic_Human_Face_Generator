# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FACE GENERATOR

## Description

This project is the Fourth project of the _Deep Learning nanodegree_, schooled by **Udacity, Inc.** ([https://eu.udacity.com](https://eu.udacity.com/)), a for-profit educational organization offering massive open online courses.

The project objective is to create and train a Deep Learning Model using Generative Adverserial Network which can transform and generate realistic-looking human faces from random noise given as input.

In this repository, you will find the following files and folders:

-   The file  _**dlnd_face_generation.ipynb**_, the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the detailed and explained study, accompanied by the results obtained;
-   The folder  _problem_unittests.py_, a python script that contains helper functions used in the project code.
-   The file  _report.html_, which is a web page that contains the details of the project

Finally, to conclude, respectively to the requirements, it can be said that the deep learning model built within this study has been constructed thanks to  **PyTorch**  ([https://pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/)), the deep learning framework mainly supported and developed by  **Facebook**  and its  **FAIR**  (Facebook AI Research) team ([https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/)).
